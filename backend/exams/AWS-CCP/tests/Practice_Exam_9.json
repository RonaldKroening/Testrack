It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them.     - The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer.     - This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency.     - So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.
