        "answer": [
            "A"
        ],
        "explanation": "A Mirror Site is considered the most expensive and extensive IT risk mitigation strategy because it involves maintaining a complete replica of the primary site, including all servers, data, applications, and infrastructure. This means that in the event of a disaster or outage, the mirror site can take over operations with minimal downtime and data loss, as it is continuously updated to reflect the current state of the primary site. Here's a brief overview of the other options for context: Hot Site: A hot site has all the necessary hardware and software to resume operations quickly, but it may not have the most current data if backups are not performed in real-time. It is less expensive than a mirror site but still costly. Warm Site: A warm site has some hardware and may have partial data, but it requires additional setup and data restoration before it can be fully operational. It is less expensive than a hot site. Cold Site: A cold site provides only the basic infrastructure (like power and water) and requires the most time and effort to become operational after a disaster. Thus, the mirror site represents the highest level of preparedness and investment in IT risk mitigation strategies."

It is designed to take over operations immediately with no data loss in the event of a failure at the primary site. A Hot Site, while also fully equipped to take over operations quickly, may not necessarily have real-time data replication. It is configured to be operational quickly but may not always have the most current data if it is not continuously updated. Thus, the primary difference lies in the fact that a mirrored site maintains an identical configuration and real-time data, while a hot site may have similar configurations but does not guarantee the same level of data synchronization."

        "explanation": "A Cold Site is a backup site that provides the basic infrastructure (such as power, water, and space) but does not have any pre-installed hardware, software, or data. In the event of a disaster, a cold site requires significant time to set up and configure the necessary systems and restore data from backups. This results in the longest recovery time for business operations compared to other types of sites. A Mobile Site typically refers to a temporary site that can be set up quickly, often used for specific events or emergencies. A Hot Site is fully equipped with hardware and software and can be operational almost immediately, resulting in minimal recovery time. A Warm Site has some hardware and may have partial data, allowing for a quicker recovery than a cold site but still requiring some setup and data restoration."
